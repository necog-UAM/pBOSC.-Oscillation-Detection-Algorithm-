# pBOSC.-Oscillation-Detection-Algorithm-
pBOSC is a method aimed at detecting oscillatory episodes at the source level in electrophysiological data.

## Scripts:
- \OMEGA_MAIN\Batch_OMEGA.m: main script with functions to apply pBOSC to OMEGA raw data. Steps include (1) preprocesing, (2) source-reconstruction, (3) compute aperiodic component, (4) extract episodes.
- \Simulation\Batch_Simulations: main script with functions to simulate MEG data and apply pBOSC to simulations.
- \Basefunctions: functions used inside other pBOSC functions.

## Files:
Necessary files used during pBOSC. Download from:

## Raw:
Raw OMEGA data downloaded from (https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/resources/omega). 

## OMEGA: 
Processed files (eg: datasource) 

## Simresults:
Store the performance of pBOSC under multiple simulations.
